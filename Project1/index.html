    <p>The <em>domestic dog</em> (Canis lupus familiaris) is a usually furry, carnivorous member of the Canidae family. Domestic dogs are commonly known as "man's best friend". The dog was the first domesticated animal and has been widely kept as a working, hunting, and pet companion. It is estimated there are between 700 million and one billion domestic dogs, making them the most abundant member of order Carnivora.</p>

    <h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>

    <p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris), based on nuclear DNA evidence as of January 2014, began from a single domestication 11 to 16 thousand years ago that predates the rise of agriculture and implies that the earliest dogs arose along with hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists.[26] Mitochondrial DNA evidence as of November 2013 indicates that all modern dogs are most closely related to the extant and extinct canids of Europe[27][28] compared to earlier writers who proposed the origins from Eurasia as well as Eastern Asia.</p>

    <p>The analysis indicates that the dog is not a descendant of the extant (i.e. living) Gray wolf but forms a sister clade, and that dogs were originally domesticated from a now-extinct wolf population that was more genetically diverse than todayâ€™s wolf population. The dog's genetic closeness to modern wolves is due to admixture.</p>

    <p>Conceivably, proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kills. Furthermore, several ancient dogs may represent failed domestication events, such as the 36,000 year old Goyet specimen of Belgium and the 33,000 year old Altai Mountains specimen from Russia, as they have no descendents today.[27][33]</p>
