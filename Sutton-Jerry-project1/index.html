    <p>The <em>domestic dog</em> (Canis lupus familiaris) is a usually furry, carnivorous member of the Canidae family. Domestic dogs are commonly known as "man's best friend". The dog was the first domesticated animal and has been widely kept as a working, hunting, and pet companion. It is estimated there are between 700 million and one billion domestic dogs, making them the most abundant member of order Carnivora.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Here are five of the most common dog breeds</p>

    <h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>

    <p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris), based on nuclear <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> evidence as of January 2014, began from a single domestication 11 to 16 thousand years ago that predates the rise of agriculture and implies that the earliest dogs arose along with hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists. Mitochondrial <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> evidence as of November 2013 indicates that all modern dogs are most closely related to the extant and extinct canids of Europe compared to earlier writers who proposed the origins from Eurasia as well as Eastern Asia.</p>

    <p>The analysis indicates that the dog is not a descendant of the extant (i.e. living) Gray wolf but forms a sister clade, and that dogs were originally domesticated from a now-extinct wolf population that was more genetically diverse than todayâ€™s wolf population. The dog's genetic closeness to modern wolves is due to admixture.</p>

    <p>Conceivably, proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kills. Furthermore, several ancient dogs may represent failed domestication events, such as the 36,000 year old Goyet specimen of Belgium and the 33,000 year old Altai Mountains specimen from Russia, as they have no descendents today.</p>

    <h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>

    <p>Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that of their wild wolf ancestors. Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.</p>

    <p>Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb) and was 250 cm (98 in) from the snout to the tail. The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the shoulder.</p>

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

    <p>Despite their descent from wolves and classification as Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores. Unlike obligate carnivores, such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine, dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements. Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet. Compared to their wolf ancestors, dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.</p>
